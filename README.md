# Partial Keepinventory
A fabric mod for changing the behaviour of keep inventory. \

Take this fancy list of things I'm working on.

| Feature                                     | State   |
|---------------------------------------------|---------|
| Custom formulas for droprates               | Done    |
| Per-item configurable droprates using rules | Planned |
| Custom formulas for experience              | Done    |
For more information on what I'm planning and working on see [the Roadmap](https://github.com/atiedebee/Partial-Keepinventory/wiki/Roadmap)

### Expression presets:

#### Distance falloff
Change DISTANCE_IN_BLOCKS to the distance from spawn where you stop dropping items (the droprate decreases linearly).
> max(0.0, min(1-(spawnDistance/DISTANCE_IN_BLOCKS), 1.0))

## Experience Droprate
There's currently 2 variables that change how XP is dropped:
- Loss percentage (How much experience is lost) 
- Drop percentage (How much of that experience is dropped)

> /pki xp droprate [drop / loss] <percentage>

There's also 2 "modes" in which these variables can operate.
- Based on levels
- Based on experience points

Levels take increasingly more experience to get, which makes that mode increasingly more punishing when you're on a higher level.
> /pki xp mode [vanilla / static-level / static-points]
